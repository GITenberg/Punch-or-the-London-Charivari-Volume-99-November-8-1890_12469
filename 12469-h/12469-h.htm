    <h3>No. V.&mdash;MIGNON'S MESS-ROOM.</h3>

    </blockquote>

    <h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Three blind mice&mdash;</p>

            <p>See how they run."</p>

            <p class="i4">&mdash;<i>Old Song</i>,</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The Officers of the Purple Dragoons were gathered together
    in their ante-room. It was a way they had. They were all there.
    Grand fellows, too, most of them&mdash;tall, broad-shouldered,
    and silky-haired, and as good as gold. That gets tiresome after
    a time, but everything can be set right with one downright
    rascally villain&mdash;a villain, mind you, that poor, weak
    women, know nothing about. GAVOR was that kind of man. Of
    course that was why he was to break his neck, and get smashed
    up generally. But I am anticipating, and a man should never
    anticipate. EMILY, for instance, never did. EMILY&mdash;Captain
    EMILY, of the Purple Dragoons&mdash;was the biggest fool in the
    Service. Everybody told him so; and EMILY, who had a trustful,
    loving nature, always believed what he was told.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:50%;">
        <a href="images/217.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/217.png"
             alt="Mignon and the Officers of the Purple Dragoons." />
             </a>
    </div>

    <p>"I nev-ah twry," he used to say&mdash;it was a difficult
    word to pronounce, but EMILY always stuck to it as only a
    soldier can. and got it out somehow&mdash;"I nev-ah twry to
    wremember things the wwrong way wround."</p>

    <p>A roar of laughter greeted this sally. They all knew he
    meant "anticipate," but they all loved their EMILY far too well
    to set him right.</p>

    <p>"'Pon my soul," he continued, "it's quite twrue. You fellows
    may wroawr wiv laughtewr if you like, but it's twrue, and you
    know it's twrne."</p>

    <p>There was another explosion of what EMILY would have called
    "mewrwriment," at this, for it was well-known to be one of the
    gallant dragoon's most humorous efforts. A somewhat protracted
    silence followed. FOOTLES, however, took it in both hands, and
    broke it with no greater emotion than he would have shown if he
    had been called upon to charge a whole squadron of
    Leicestershire Bullfinches, or to command a Lord Mayor's escort
    on the 9th of November. Dear old FOOTLES! He wasn't clever, no
    Purple Dragoon could be, but he wasn't the biggest fool in the
    Service, like EMILY, and all the rest of them. Still he loved
    another's.</p>

    <p>In fact, whenever a Purple Dragoon fell in love, the object
    of his affections immediately pretended to love someone else.
    Hard lines, but soldiers were born to suffer. It is so easy, so
    true, so usual to say, "there's another day to-morrow," but
    that never helped even a Purple Dragoon to worry through to-day
    any the quicker. Poor, brave, noble, drawling, manly,
    pipe-smoking fellows! On this particular occasion FOOTLES
    uttered only one word. It was short, and began with the fourth
    letter of the alphabet. But he may be pardoned, for some of the
    glowing embers from his magnificent briar-wood pipe had dropped
    on to his regulation overalls. The result was painful&mdash;to
    FOOTLES. All the others laughed as well as they could, with
    clays, meerschaums, briars, and asbestos pipes in their mouths.
    And through the thick cloud of scented smoke the mess-waiter
    came into the room, bearing in his hand a large registered
    letter, and coughing violently.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"The mouse ran up the clock."</p>

            <p class="i4">&mdash;<i>Nursery Rhyme</i>.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The waiter advanced slowly to FOOTLES, and handed him the
    letter. FOOTLES took it meditatively, and turned it over in
    both hands. The post-marks were illegible, and the envelope
    much crumpled. "Never mind," thought FOOTLES, to himself, "it
    will dry straight&mdash;it will dry straight." He always
    thought this twice, because it was one of his favourite
    phrases. At last he decided to open it. As he broke the seal a
    little cry was heard, and suddenly, before even EMILY had had
    time to say "I nev-ah!" a charming and beautifully dressed
    girl, of about fifteen summers, sprang lightly from the packet
    on to the mess-room floor, and kissed her pretty little hand to
    the astonished Dragoons.</p>

    <p>"You're FOOTLES," she said, skipping up to the
    thunder-stricken owner of the name. "I know you very well. I'm
    going to be your daughter, and you're going to marry my mother.
    Oh, it's all right," she continued, as she observed FOOTLES
    press his right hand convulsively to the precise spot on his
    gorgeous mess-waistcoat under which he imagined his heart to be
    situated, "it's all right. Pa's going to be comfortably killed,
    and put out of the way, and then you'll marry darling Mamma.
    She'll be a thousand times more beautiful at thirty-three than
    she was at twenty-two, and <i>ever</i> so much more lovely at
    fifty-five than at thirty-three. So it's a good bargain, isn't
    it, EM?" This to EMILY, who appeared confused. She trotted up
    to him, and laid her soft blooming cheek against his blooming
    hard one. "Never mind, EM," she lisped, "everything is bound to
    come out right. I've settled it all"&mdash;this with a
    triumphant look on her baby-face&mdash;"with the author; such a
    splendid writer, none of your twaddling women-scribblers, but a
    real man, and a great friend of mine. I'm to marry you, EM. You
    don't know it, because you once loved NAOMI, who 'mawrwried the
    Wrevewrend SOLOMON'"&mdash;at this point most of the Purple
    Dragoons were rude enough to yawn openly. She paid no attention
    to them&mdash;"and now you love OLIVE, but she loves PARKACK,
    and he doesn't love her, so she has got to marry PARKOSS, whom
    she doesn't love. Their initials are the same, and everybody
    knows their caligraphy is exactly alike," she went on wearily,
    "so that's how the mistake arose. It's a bit far-fetched, but,"
    and her arch smile as she said this would have melted a harder
    heart than Captain EMILY's, "we mustn't be too particular in a
    soldier's tale, you know."</p>

    <p>As she concluded her remarks the door opened, and Colonel
    PURSER entered the room.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Pat a cake, pat a cake, baker's man."</p>

            <p class="i4">&mdash;<i>Old Ballad</i>.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Colonel PURSER was a stout, plethoric man. He was five feet
    seven inches high, forty-five inches round the chest, fifty
    inches round the waist, and every inch of him was a soldier. He
    was, therefore, a host in himself. He gasped, and turned red,
    but, like a real soldier, at once grasped the situation. The
    Colonel was powerful, and the situation, in spite of all my
    pains, was not a strong one. The struggle was short.</p>

    <p>"Pardon me," said the Colonel, when he had recovered his
    wind, "is your name MIGNON?"</p>

    <p>"Yes," she replied, as the tears brimmed over in her lovely
    eyes, "it is. I am a simple soldier's child, but, oh, I can run
    so beautifully&mdash;through ever so many volumes, and lots of
    editions. In fact," she added, confidentially, "I don't see why
    I should stop at all, do you? EMILY <i>must</i> marry me. He
    can't marry OLIVE, because Dame Nature put in <i>her</i> eyes
    with a dirty finger. Ugh! I've got blue eyes."</p>

    <p>"But," retorted the Colonel, quickly, "shall you never
    quarrel?"</p>

    <p>"Oh yes," answered MIGNON, "there will come a rift in the
    hitherto perfect lute of our friendship (the rift's name will
    be DARKEY), but we shall manage to bridge it over&mdash;at
    least TOM RUM SUMMER says so." Here EMILY broke in. He could
    stand it no longer. "Dash it, you know, this is wewry
    extwraowrdinawry, wewry extwraowrdinawry indeed," he observed;
    "You'wre a most wremawrkable young woman, you know."</p>

    <p>A shout of laughter followed this remark, and in the fog of
    tobacco-smoke Colonel PURSER could be dimly seen draining a
    magnum of champagne.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Hey diddle, diddle."</p>

            <p class="i4">&mdash;<i>Songs and Romances</i>.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Everything fell out exactly as MIGNON prophesied. But if you
    think that you've come to the end of MIGNON, I can only say
    you're very much astray, or as EMILY, with his smooth silky
    voice, and his smoother silkier manners, would have said,
    "You'wre wewry much astwray." See my next dozen stories.</p>

    <h2>A BOOTHIFUL IDEA!</h2>

    <p>Just finished my article on "Antediluvian Arch&aelig;ology
    in its relation to Genesis and the Iliad," and now all that
    remains to do is to carry the rest of my books down to the new
    library, make catalogue, consider subjects for five more
    speeches, write thirty-six letters and postcards, and polish
    off the ten last clauses of the Home-Rule Bill. This idleness
    is oppressive. Not used to it. What shall I do?</p>

    <p>Piles of correspondence by morning post! What <i>can</i>
    this be about? Ah! I remember now! <i>Nineteenth Century</i>
    just out, of course. Glad I thought of starting "Society of
    Universal Beneficence." Will keep me going after excitement of
    Midlothian. Wonder how many people will "bind themselves to
    give away a fixed proportion of their income,"&mdash;also what
    the proportion will be, if they do. Don't know if I
    <i>should</i> have thought of it, if it hadn't been for General
    BOOTH's book. Remarkable person, the General. Perhaps he'd
    order his Army to vote solid for Home Rule, if I offered him a
    place in my next Cabinet? Must sound him on the subject.
    Salvationists quite a power now. Can't cut Field-Marshal VON
    BOOTH <i>up</i> in a Magazine, so must cut him <i>out</i>
    instead!</p>

    <p>Ha! Letter from LABOUCHERE, of all people. H&mdash;m! Says
    he's "glad to see I've started Universal Beneficence Society.
    Thought of doing so himself once." Congratulates me on turning
    my attention to "Social Reform." Says he thinks it's an
    "Ecclesent idea,"&mdash;he must mean "Excellent," surely!</p>

    <p>"Inquirer"&mdash;(post-mark, Hatfield. Curious circumstance,

    "Prefers at present to remain anonymous," but an answer sent to
    "S., Hatfield House," will always find him! Meanwhile, encloses
    postal order for one pound ten shillings a "fixed proportion of
    his income," as he sees that I've "offered to make myself the
    careful recipient of any assents," by which he supposes that I
    mean cash. A little embarrassing!</p>

    <p>Take stroll in Park to collect my thoughts. Find two leading
    Belfast linen-merchants busily gathering up sawdust, &amp;c,
    round tree I felled yesterday. They explain that they've
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page219"
       id="page219"></a>[pg 219]</span> been "much interested in my
       novel idea of converting chips of wood into best cambric
       pocket-handkerchiefs," and think that it beats General
       BOOTH's notion of making children's toys out of old
       sardine-tins hollow. I should rather think it did! Still,
       have to confess that I'm <i>not</i> ready at present to
       "quote them my wholesale price for best oak-shavings
       delivered free on rail."</p>

    <p>Telegram from&mdash;CHAMBERLAIN! Says he sees the new
    Society's one of "universal" beneficence, and supposes it
    includes him! Quite a mistake! Sends cheque for three pounds,
    and hopes I'll "keep a strict account of all sums received, and
    issue a report and balance-sheet shortly." Really, very
    injudicious of me to use word "universal"! Ought to have
    expressly excluded Liberal-Unionists (so-called), from my plan.
    That's where General BOOTH has advantage of me. <i>He</i>
    probably doesn't exclude anybody that wants to send him money.
    Perhaps, after all, he knows how to do this sort of thing
    better than I do.</p>

    <p>Wire to him, and hand him over the money I've already
    received, also ask him to start a "universally beneficent"
    branch of Salvation Army. Receive reply, accepting my offer, in
    no time! General adds that he has a staff appointment in his
    Army waiting for me, and that he would like my good lady to
    become a Salvation Lass. Requires consideration
    and&mdash;hem&mdash;consultation!</p>

    <h2>VOCES POPULI.</h2>

    <h3>AT THE PASTEL EXHIBITION.</h3>

    <h4>IN THE ANTE-ROOM.</h4>

    <p><i>A Niece</i>. Just one moment, Auntie, dear; <i>do</i>
    look and see what No. 295 is!</p>

    <p><i>Her Aunt</i> (<i>with a Catalogue&mdash;and a
    conscience</i>). Two hundred and ninety-five! Before we have
    even seen No. 1? No, my dear, no. Let us take things in their
    proper order&mdash;or not at all. (<i>Perambulates the
    galleries for some minutes, refraining religiously from looking
    at anything but the numbers.</i>) Ah, <i>here</i> it
    is&mdash;Number One! <i>Now</i>, ETHEL, I'm ready to tell you
    anything you please!</p>

    <p><i>First Matter-of-Fact Person</i>. Ah, here's another of
    the funny ones! [<i>Is suddenly seized with depression.</i></p>

    <p><i>Second M.-of-F.P.</i> Y-yes. (<i>Examines it
    gloomily.</i>) What's it all about?</p>

    <p><i>First M.-of-F.P.</i> (<i>blankly</i>). Oh, well, it's a
    Pastel&mdash;I don't suppose it's meant to be about anything in
    particular, you know.</p>

    <p><i>The Conscientious Aunt</i> (<i>before No. 129</i>).
    "<i>The Sprigged Frock</i>"? Yes, that must be the one. I
    suppose those <i>are</i> meant for sprigs&mdash;but I can't
    make out the pattern. She <i>might</i> have made her hair a
    little tidier&mdash;such a bush! and I never <i>do</i> think
    blue and green go well together, myself.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>They come to a portrait of a charming lady in grey,
        by</i> Mr. SOLOMON.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>The Niece</i> (<i>with a sense of being on firm ground at
    last</i>). Why, it's ELLEN TERRY! See if it isn't, Auntie.</p>

    <p><i>The C.A.</i> (<i>referring to Catalogue</i>).</p>

    <div class="poem">

    <p>&mdash;that's all it <i>says</i> about it.</p>

    <p><i>The Niece</i> (<i>finding a certain vagueness in this as
    a description</i>). Oh! But there are <i>no</i>
    leaves&mdash;unless it means the leaves in the book she's
    reading. Still I think it <i>must</i> be ELLEN TERRY; don't
    you?</p>

    <p><i>The C.A.</i> (<i>cautiously</i>.) Well, my dear, I always
    think it's as well not to be too positive about a portrait till
    you know who it was painted from.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>The</i> Matter-of-Fact Persons <i>have arrived at a
        Pastel representing several green and yellow ladies seated
        undraped around a fountain, with fiddles suspended to the

    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Second M.-of-F.P.</i> "<i>Marigolds</i>," that's called.
    I don't <i>see</i> any though. [<i>With a sense of being
    imposed upon.</i></p>

    <p><i>First M.-of-F.P.</i> I think <i>I</i> do&mdash;yes, those
    orange spots in the green. They're meant for Marigolds, but
    there aren't very many of them, are there? And why should they
    all be sitting on the grass like that? Enough to give them
    their deaths of cold!</p>

    <p><i>Second M.-of-F.P.</i> I expect they've been bathing.</p>

    <p><i>First M.-of-F.P.</i> They couldn't <i>all</i> bathe in
    that fountain, and then what do you make of their bringing out
    their violins?</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>The other</i> M.-of-F. Person <i>making nothing of
        it, they pass on.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>An Irritable Philistine</i>. Nonsense, Sir, you
    <i>can't</i> admire them, don't tell <i>me</i>! Do you mean to
    say <i>you</i> ever saw all those blues, and greens, and
    yellows, in Nature, Sir?</p>

    <p><i>His Companion</i>. I mean to say that that is how Nature
    appears to an eye trained to see things in a true and not a
    merely conventional light.</p>

    <p><i>The I.P.</i>. Then all <i>I</i> can say is, that if
    things ever appeared to <i>me</i> as unconventionally as all
    that, I should go straight home and take a couple of liver
    pills, Sir. I should!</p>

    <p><i>First Frivolous Old Lady</i>. Here's another of them, my
    dear. It's no use, we've <i>got</i> to admire it, this is the
    kind of thing you and I must be educated up to in our old
    age!</p>

    <p><i>Second F.O.L.</i> It makes me feel as if I was on board a
    yacht, that's all I know&mdash;just look at the perspective in
    that room, all slanted up!</p>

    <p><i>First F.O.L.</i> That's your ignorance, my dear, it's
    quite the right perspective for a Pastel, it's our rooms that
    are all wrong&mdash;not these clever young gentlemen.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>They go about chuckling and poking old ladylike fun
        at all the more eccentric Pastels, and continue to enjoy
        themselves immensely.</i></p>

    <p><i>First M.-of-F.P. (they have come to a Pastel depicting a
    young woman seated on the Crescent Moon, nursing an
    infant</i>). H'm&mdash;very peculiar. <i>I</i> never saw Diana
    represented with a <i>baby</i> before&mdash;did <i>you</i>?</p>

    <p><i>Second M.-of-F.P.</i>
    No&mdash;(<i>hopefully</i>)&mdash;but perhaps it's intended for
    somebody else. But it's <i>not</i> the place <i>I</i> should
    choose to nurse an infant in. It doesn't look safe, and it
    can't be very comfortable.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>They go on into a smaller room, and come upon a

    <p><i>Second M.-of-F.P.</i> What there <i>is</i> of it; but it

    black that he forgot to put in the little girl&mdash;he's got
    her <i>mouth</i>, though.</p>

    <p><i>First M.-of-F.P.</i>. Well, if it was <i>my</i> child, I

    </blockquote>

    <p><i>The R.L.</i>. Isn't that portrait quite wonderful!
    Wouldn't you take it for an oil-painting?</p>

    <p><i>The S.P.</i>. One might&mdash;without some
    experience&mdash;which is just where it is so entirely wrong. A
    Pastel has no business to imitate the <i>technique</i> of any
    other medium.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page220"
       id="page220"></a>[pg 220]</span>

    <p><i>The R.L.</i> Oh, I think you are <i>so</i> right.
    Because, after all, it <i>is</i> only a Pastel, isn't it? and
    it oughtn't to pretend to be anything else. (<i>She looks
    reproachfully at the too ambitious Pastel</i>.) And it isn't as
    if it was <i>successful</i>, either&mdash;it won't bear being
    looked into at all closely.</p>

    <p><i>The S.P.</i> You should never look at a Pastel closely;
    they are meant to be seen from a distance.</p>

    <p><i>The R.L.</i> (<i>brightly</i>). Or else you miss the
    effect? I <i>quite</i> see. Now, I like
    <i>this</i>&mdash;(<i>indicating a vague and streaky little
    picture</i>)&mdash;don't you? That's what I call a <i>real</i>
    Pastel.</p>

    <p><i>The S.P.</i> (<i>screwing up his eyes</i>). H'm! Yes.
    Perhaps. Clever-ish. Suggestive.</p>

    <p><i>The R.L.</i> (<i>shocked</i>). Oh, <i>do</i> you think
    so? I don't see anything of <i>that</i> kind in it&mdash;at
    least, I don't think it can be <i>intentional</i>.</p>

    <p><i>The S.P.</i> The beauty of Art <i>is</i> to suggest, to
    give work for the imagination.</p>

    <p><i>The R.L.</i> (<i>recovering herself</i>). I know so
    <i>exactly</i> what you mean&mdash;just as one makes all sorts
    of things out of the patches of damp on an old ceiling?</p>

    <p><i>The S.P.</i> Hardly. I should define Damp as the product
    of Nature&mdash;not <i>Art</i>.</p>

    <p><i>The R.L.</i> Oh, yes; if you put it in that way, of
    <i>course</i>! I only meant it as an illustration&mdash;the two
    things are really as different as possible. (<i>Changes the
    subject.</i>) They don't seem to mind <i>what</i> coloured
    paper they use for Pastels, do they?</p>

    <p><i>The S.P.</i> (<i>oracularly</i>). It
    is&mdash;er&mdash;always advisable in Pastels to use a tone of
    paper to harmonise as nearly as possible with the particular
    tone you&mdash;er&mdash;want. Because, you see, as the colour
    doesn't always cover the <i>whole</i> of the paper, if the
    paper which shows through is different in tone,
    it&mdash;er&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>The R.L.</i> Won't match? I <i>see</i>. How clever!
    (<i>She arrives at a highly eccentric composition, and ventures
    upon an independent opinion.</i>) Now I can't say I care for
    <i>that</i>&mdash;there's so very little done to it, and what
    there is is so glaring and <i>crude</i>, don't you think? I
    call it <i>stupid</i>.</p>

    <p><i>The S.P.</i> I was just about to say that it is the
    cleverest thing in the Exhibition&mdash;from an artistic point
    of view. No special interest in it, but the scheme of colour
    very harmonious&mdash;and very decorative.</p>

    <p><i>The R.L.</i> Oh, <i>isn't</i> it? That's <i>just</i> the
    right word for it&mdash;it is <i>so</i> decorative! and I do
    like the scheme of colour. Yes, it's very clever. I quite feel
    <i>that</i> about it. (<i>With a gush</i>.) It is <i>so</i>
    nice looking at pictures with somebody who has exactly the same
    tastes as oneself. And I always <i>was</i> fond of
    pastilles!</p>

    <p><i>A Pavement Pastellist</i> (<i>to a friend</i>). Well,
    JIM, I dunno what <i>you</i> think, but I call it a shellin'
    clean chucked away, I do. I come in yere,&mdash;hearin' as all
    the subjicks was done in chorks, same as I do my own&mdash;I
    come in on the chance o' pickin' up a notion or two as might be
    useful to me in my perfession. But, Lor, they ain't got a ideer
    among 'em, that they ain't! They ain't took the measure of the
    popilar taste not by a nundred miles, they 'aven't. Why, I
    ain't seen a single thing as I'd reckincile it to my conscience
    to perduce before <i>my</i> public&mdash;there ain't 'ardly a
    droring in the 'ole bloomin' show as I'd be seen settin' down
    beyind! Put down some of these 'ere Pastellers to do a mouse a
    nibbling at a candle, or a battle in the Soudang, or a rat
    snifin' at a smashed hegg, and you'd soon see <i>they</i> was
    no good! Precious few coppers 'ud fall into <i>their</i> 'ats,
    I'll go bail! [<i>Exit indignantly, as Scene closes.</i></p>

    <h2>EXCELLENT EXAMPLE.</h2>

    <p>In a recent trial for Breach of Promise, a letter was read
    from Defendant saying that "he must now get a monkey;"
    whereupon the "learned Under-Sheriff," as reported in the
    <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, exclaimed, "A Monkey! What the goodness
    does he mean?" Now, isn't that better than saying, "What the
    deuce?" Of course, no doubt the learned Under-Sheriff is
    suficiently learned to remember the old rhyme&mdash;</p>

    excellent idea, that may be developed to almost any extent.
    Could we not have the Hero who had read every Novel that has
    been published during the last six months; the Brave Man who
    has been to every Dramatic <i>Matin&eacute;e</i> since January;
    and the Scorner of Death, who has existed during an entire
    season in the odours (sweet, or otherwise) of Kensington and
    Tyburnia? The latter on the present occasion might immediately
    precede the Lord MAYOR Elect, for, by association of ideas, he

    <h2>OPERATIC NOTES.</h2>

    <p><i>Monday</i>.&mdash;<i>Rentr&eacute;e</i> of Miss MAGGIE

    Macintyrely first-rate," says our <i>blas&eacute;</i> young
    man, on being caught napping after the Opera, and interviewed
    on the spot, "but can't say much for the rest,"&mdash;except
    the rest he took himself.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;Our <i>blas&eacute;</i> young man went
    to this, but as we only saw him for a moment passing in a cab,
    when he looked out, and bade us a "Good night," we can only
    suppose that it was "a good night" at the Opera. He writes to
    say that the performance of <i>The Huguenots</i> was excellent,
    GIULIA RAVOGLI being specially good, but the draughts too
    strong. <i>What draughts?</i></p>

    </div>

    <p><i>Wednesday</i>.&mdash;<i>La Gioconda</i>. A good
    performance all round. But the night specially memorable as
    being the first appearance of Miss GRACE DAMIAN on the stage of
    the Royal Italian Opera anywhere. It is a good omen for her
    that she appeared in Signor PONCHIELLI's Opera, the composer
    being a distant connection of the great ancient Italian family
    of the PONCINELLI, of which <i>Mr. Punch</i> is now the chief
    universal representative. It is a remarkable fact, too, showing
    the strong force of canine attachment, which centuries cannot
    obliterate, that the <i>Libretto</i> of <i>La Gioconda</i>, set
    to music by Signor PONCHIELLI (the "h" came in when the genuine
    liquid "n" was dropped) was written by TOBIA GORRIO. That an
    Opera, written by TOBIA, or TOBY, and composed by PUNCINELLO,
    should possess all the elements of success, goes without
    saying. We welcome Signor GALASSI (a sporting title, reminding
    us of <i>Gay Lass</i>), with MARIA PERI (who must appear in
    <i>Il Paradiso</i>), and GIULIA RAVOGLI. Her Grace of DAMIAN
    made a most successful <i>d&eacute;but</i> as <i>La Cieca</i>,
    and was cheered to the echo. Thank Heaven, there isn't an echo
    in Covent Garden&mdash;but, if there had been, Echo would have
    repeated hospitably the "good cheer" a dozen times, as she does
    somewhere about Killarney. Signor LAGO stars "HER MAJESTY THE
    QUEEN" at the head of his bill, but it is only to say that Her
    Gracious MAJESTY has been graciously pleased to honour him by
    subscribing for the Royal Box during the present season, which
    is, in effect, saying that he has <i>let the best box in the
    house for a Sovereign!</i></p>

    <p><i>Thursday Night</i>.&mdash;ALBANI as the unhappy
    <i>Traviata</i>. Big and enthusiastic House. Signor PADILLA, as
    the Elder <i>Germont</i>, excellent, and just contrived most
    gracefully to refuse the honour of an <i>encore</i> for his
    "<i>Di Provenza</i>." Since RONCONI, it is difficult to call to
    mind an artist equal histrionically to Signor PADILLA, who is
    so grave and impressive as that utter bore, "the Elder
    <i>Germont</i>," so gay and eccentric as <i>Figaro</i>, and so
    dashing and reckless as the unscrupulous <i>Don Giovanni</i>.
    That milksop, <i>Germont</i> Junior, known as <i>Alfredo</i>,
    was adequately played by Signor GIANNINI, whose name, were it
    spelt GIA-"NINNY," would partly describe the character he
    represented.</p>

    <p><i>Friday Night</i>.&mdash;Our <i>blas&eacute;</i> young man
    writes to say, "I am suffering from effects of draughts at
    Opera. Think it must be some Operatic air which has given me
    cold. It's a gruel case for yours truly."</p>

    <p><i>Saturday Night</i>.&mdash;Occasion described as
    "popular;" and, consequently, <i>Il Trovatore</i> announced. A
    little old-fashioned, but what of that? VERDI just the composer
    "to keep your memory green." Alas! cold once more to the front.
    The <i>blas&eacute;</i> one "still off duty, so no reliable
    report to hand." No doubt everything passed off pleasantly.
    <i>Manrico</i> obviously, when on the stage, more of a man than
    <i>Germont</i> Junior. The standing line has been, "large
    audience much pleased with the entertainment." Altogether a
    successful week.'</p>

    <h2>TO ENGELBERG AND BACK.</h2>

    <h4><i>Being a few Notes taken en route in search of a Perfect
    Cure.</i></h4>

    <p>"Give him another month here, and he'll be giving you all
    the slip, and walking back to Calais on foot." Young JERRYMAN
    is commenting on the wonderful restoration that has taken place
    in the condition of the Dilapidated One, who has just been
    detected having a row on the lake, all by himself. Not that
    this is a very prodigious aquatic feat, seeing that three or
    four good strokes either way take you either into the bank, or
    on to the heels or tails of a couple of very ill-tempered, and
    irascible swans, who appear to think, and with some reason,
    that there's not too much waterway as it is, and resent the
    intrusion of the boat on their domain as a ridiculous
    superfluity. However, the effort is one that the Dilapidated
    One would not have ventured on at his arrival a month since,
    and as our time is up, and we are starting on our return
    journey home in about half-an-hour's time, we hail it as an
    indication that if he has not quite obtained the Perfect Cure,
    that his medical man promised him, as the result of a trip to
    this delightful spot, he is certainly not far off it.</p>

    <p>But the best things must come to an end, and so we find
    ourselves at length, with much regret, taking our farewell of
    that excellent and capitally-conducted "Perfect Kurhaus" the
    H&ocirc;tel Titlis. And this reminds me, that in justice to
    that establishment, I ought to state that some comments I made
    last week on German feeding in general, in no way were meant to
    refer to the <i>table d'h&ocirc;te</i> at the H&ocirc;tel
    Titlis, which, served in a lofty and well-ventilated
    <i>salon</i>, lighted by electricity, to four hundred people
    daily, a capitally well-appointed meal, is one of the notable
    features of the place. The smoke-stifled children of the
    Fatherland, who shut every window they come across when they
    get a chance, though they would dearly like to, cannot carry
    their tricks on here. Sometimes, but not very often, they rally
    in force, and render the "<i>Grosser Gesellschafts Saal</i>" a
    sort of Tophet to the ordinary Briton; but the "<i>Speise
    Saal</i>", where smoking is "<i>verboten</i>," is happily
    beyond their reach. But the hour of departure has come, and
    quitting his comfortable establishment with much regret, we bid
    good-bye to the courteous Herr CATTANI, and with a crack of the
    whip we are off, dashing down the valley, and leaving Engelberg
    up on its heights as a pleasant dream behind us.</p>

    </div>

    <p>And what is Engelberg? There is, first and foremost, <i>par
    excellence</i>, the feature of the place&mdash;the H&ocirc;tel
    Titlis; then the Monastery, with the Brethren of the Bell-rope;
    and <i>the</i> Street. This is unique. Set out with a
    <i>Ch&acirc;let</i> here, a Swiss <i>Pension</i> there, a
    Chapel perched up on a little hill on one side, and a neatly
    new-made farmhouse stuck up on the other, with cattle (not
    omitting their dinner-bells) dotted about here and there in the
    bright green meadows that creep up to, and melt into, the
    pine-woods stretching from the base of the grand rugged
    snow-capped heights that tower in every direction above, you
    get thoroughly impressed with the idea that the whole place is
    nothing but a box of toys, set out for the season (probably by
    the Monks), who, you feel convinced, are only waiting for the
    departure of the last visitor, to get out the box, and
    carefully pack away <i>Ch&acirc;let</i>, and <i>Pension</i>,
    Chapel and peasant for the winter months, with a view to
    keeping them fresh for production in the early summer of next
    year.</p>

    <p>However, whatever its fate, Engelberg is left behind us, and
    we find ourselves tearing down the Practical Joking Engineers'
    Road at a break-neck pace, and hurrying on to Calais, once more
    to take our places on our steady old friend, the
    <i>Calais-Douvres</i>, that helps to deposit us finally at
    Charing Cross, where we are bound to admit that the air,
    whatever it is, is emphatically <i>not</i> the air of
    Engelberg. But everybody who has seen him, says the Dilapidated
    One has come back "twice the man he was". So we must take it
    that our journey has not been in vain.</p>

    <p>WELLS, GARDNER, DARTON &amp; Co. publish a very good
    selection of tales for young people. Among the best are
    <i>Tom's Opinion</i>, a boy whose ever readily-expressed
    opinion is made to change pretty often; and <i>Halt</i>! by the
    same author. The title is suggestive of military manoeuvres,
    but it's only a term for obeying quickly, which is hard to do
    sometimes. <i>Gregory of the Foretop</i>, <i>Abbot's
    Cleeve</i>, and <i>Going for a Soldier</i>, are three books
    containing several stories suitable to mere grown-up young
    people,&mdash;so the sooner they grow up the better for the
    sale of the books. They are all edited by J. ERSKINE CLARKE,
    M.A.</p>

    <p>FREDERICK WARNE &amp; CO. give us <i>Young England's Nursery
    Tales</i>, illustrated by CONSTANCE HASLEWOOD. <i>Noah's
    Ark</i>, by DARLBY DALE, which is not the Ark of the nursery,
    but a story of the Norfolk Broads. Perhaps "Norfolk Broads"
    would have suggested stories that could <i>not</i> be told in a
    drawing-room. As to <i>Bits about Horses for Every Day</i>,
    selected and illustrated by S. TURNER,&mdash;well, what would
    horses be without "bits?" These are not tit-bits. Might do for
    a Bridle gift.</p>

    <p><i>The Love of a Lady</i>, by Miss ANNIE THOMAS, otherwise
    Mrs. PENDER CUDLIP, like most of this authoress's novels, is
    full of interest. It is in the regulation three volumes, but
    appears as if it had wished to be in two, and would have been
    had not large type insisted upon the addition of a third tome.
    The love of a lady is transferred, during the course of the
    story, from an artist, who appears in the last chapter "in
    threadbare clothes, with broken, patched boots on his feet"
    (not on his Hands, <i>bien entendu</i>), to a "well-tailored"
    novelist. As the lady to whom "the love" originally belonged
    was "a popular illustrator," it was only natural that the
    question of appearances should play an important part in
    determining its ultimate destination.</p>

    <p>Mr. W. OUTRAM TRISTRAM is never so much in his element as
    when he revels in gore and guilt. In <i>Locusta</i>, in one
    bulky volume, he tells of "the crime" and "the chastisement."
    The first is associated with "a house with curtained windows,"
    "an Italian swordsman," "entombed," and "a maimed lion," and
    the second is developed in chapters headed, "The Hunter lets
    fly a Poisoned Shaft," "The Silver Dish of Tarts," "The First
    Victim Falls," "A Dreadful Accuser," and last, but not least,
    "The Vengeance is Crowned." As the story begins in 1612, and
    ends with the words, "HENRY, Prince of WALES, art thou not
    avenged?" it will be seen, that Mr. W. OUTRAM TRISTRAM has
    seized this opportunity to pleasantly illustrate an incident
    from English history.</p>

    <p>My faithful "Co." has been revelling in the Land of Fancy.
    He expresses delight at two books called respectively,
    <i>Dreams by French Firesides</i> and <i>English Fairy
    Tales</i>. The first is supposed to have been written before
    Paris in 1870-71 by a German soldier who had turned his
    thoughts to his home and children in the far-off Fatherland.
    The second deals with British folk-lore, and is racy of the
    soil. Both works are full of capital illustrations. He has,
    moreover, read <i>He Went for a Soldier</i>, the WYNTER Annual
    of JOHN STRANGE of that ilk. But what had the soldier done,
    that "he" should "go for him"? The answer to this conundrum
    will be ascertained on reading the book. <i>Nutshell
    Novels</i>, by J. ASHBY STERRY, is also a volume that repays
    perusal. The Lazy Poet has turned his leisure to good
    account&mdash;the stories he tells are excellent.</p>

    <p>Had the delightfully original <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>,
    and <i>Through the Looking-Glass</i>, never been written, I
    doubt much if we should ever have seen <i>Maggie in
    Mythica</i>, by F.B. DOVETON, who announces it apologetically,
    as "his first"&mdash;perhaps it maybe his "unique" fairy
    story,&mdash;and he adds, that he has "kept out of the beaten
    track as far as possible." "<i>As far as possible</i>" is good,
    for never was there such an example of the "sincerest flattery"
    than in this undeniable imitation of <i>Alice in
    Wonderland</i>. Some of the illustrations, by J. HARRINGTON
    WILSON, are not quite as weak as the text, while the best of
    them only serve to heighten our appreciation of "Our" Mr.
    TENNIEL's pictures in <i>Alice</i>, and its companion volume.
    But the very title, <i>Maggie in Mythica</i>, recalls at once
    <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, but the lovers of <i>Alice</i>, who
    being attracted by this title may purchase this book under the
    impression that "it is the same concern," will soon find out
    their mistake, though it may perhaps amuse a very much younger
    generation who know not <i>Alice</i>, if such a generation
    exist, which muchly we beg to doubt. BARON DE BOOK-WORMS &amp;

    <h2>THE REAL GRIEVANCE OFFICE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Before Mr. Commissioner Punch.</i>)</h4>

    <h4><i>An Officer of Volunteers introduced.</i></h4>

    <p><i>The Commissioner</i>. Well, what can I do for you,
    Captain?</p>

    <p><i>Officer of Volunteers</i>. Hush, Sir! If you were heard
    to give me my military rank, you would be the cause of covering
    me with ridicule!</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> Ridicule! Are you <i>not</i> a Captain?</p>

    <p><i>Off.</i> Certainly, Sir. I hold Her Majesty's Commission,
    and am supposed to be one of the defenders of the country.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> Then why should you not be credited with the
    rank to which you are entitled?</p>

    <p><i>Off.</i> Because, Sir, I am only a Captain of
    Volunteers.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> But surely the British Army is composed
    entirely of Volunteers?</p>

    <p><i>Off.</i> That is the national boast, Sir. But then, you
    see, I receive no pay.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> Which does not prevent you from working?</p>

    <p><i>Off.</i> On the contrary, Sir, nearly all my leisure is
    devoted to the study of what I may, perhaps, be permitted to
    call my supplementary profession.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> What are your duties?</p>

    <p><i>Off.</i> Almost too numerous to enumerate. Before I
    received my Commission, I had to undertake to make myself
    proficient in everything appertaining to the rank to which I
    was appointed. This entailed a month's hard work (five or six
    hours a day in the barrack-square), at one of the Schools of
    Instruction.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> Well, let us suppose that you <i>have</i>
    become duly qualified to command a company&mdash;what next?</p>

    <p><i>Off.</i> Having reached this point, I find myself called
    upon to work as hard as any Line officer on full pay. True, I
    have not (except when the battalion is camping out, or taking
    part in manoeuvres), to trouble myself with matters connected
    with the Commissariat, but in every other respect my position
    is exactly analogous to my brother officers in other branches
    of the QUEEN's Service. I have to attend numerous drills, and
    perform the duties, at stated intervals, of the Orderly Room.
    Besides this, I have to see that every parade is well attended
    by the men of my company. This entails, as you may imagine,
    time and trouble.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> May I take it that it is less difficult to
    command Volunteers than Regulars?</p>

    <p><i>Off.</i> That is a matter of opinion. If a Volunteer
    officer can bring to bear his social position (for instance,
    should his men be his tenants, or in his employment), he may
    find the task of command an easy one. But should the battalion
    to which he belongs be composed of that large class of persons
    who consider "one man as good as another, and better," no
    little tact is required in keeping up discipline. Besides this,
    he starts at a disadvantage. Every retirement from the regiment
    means the loss of an earner of the capitation grant; and as the
    maintenance of a Volunteer corps is an exceedingly expensive
    matter, a "free and independent private" feels that if he
    withdraws, or is forced to withdraw, his officers are
    practically the pecuniary sufferers of the proceeding.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> Am I to understand then that the cost of a
    battalion falls upon the commissioned rank?</p>

    <p><i>Off.</i> Almost entirely. The officers have generally to
    pay a heavy entrance fee, and subscription, and must, if they
    wish to be popular, contribute largely to prize funds,
    entertainments, and the cost of "marching out." Besides these
    charges they have to be particularly hospitable or benevolent
    (either word will do) to the companies to which they specially
    belong.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> Well, certainly, it seems that an Officer of
    Volunteers has many responsibilities&mdash;what are his
    privileges?</p>

    <p><i>Off.</i> Only one is officially recognised&mdash;the
    right to be snubbed!</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> And the result?</p>

    <p><i>Off.</i> That there is scarcely a corps in the kingdom
    without vacancies. Men nowadays, fail to see the fun of all
    work and no pay, play, or anything else. This very week a
    meeting is being held at the Royal United Service Institution,
    to consider what can be done to advance the interests of the
    officers&mdash;another word for the interests of the whole
    force.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> You have my sympathy, and if I can help
    you&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Off.</i> Not another word, Sir. The good services of
    <i>Mr. Punch</i> for the last thirty years are appreciated by
    all of us, and we know we can rely upon him as confidently in
    the future as we have done with good reason in the past.

    <h4>(<i>A Handbook to Honesty.</i>)</h4>

    <h3>NO. IV.&mdash;THE GRAND OLD (JOBBING) GARDENER.</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>the Garden of a modest Suburban Villa.
        Present</i>, Simple Citizen, <i>with budding horticultural
        ambitions, and</i> Jobbing Gardener, <i>"highly
        recommended" for skill and low charges. The latter is a
        grizzled personage, very bowed as to back, and baggy as to
        breeches, but in his manner combining oracular
        "knowingness" and deferential plausibility in a remarkable
        degree.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Simple Citizen</i>. You see SMUGGINS, things are a little
    bit in the rough here, at present.</p>

    <p><i>Grand Old Gardener</i>. Ah, you may well say that, Sir!
    Bin allowed to run to rack <i>and</i> ruin, this here pooty bit
    o' garding has. Want a lot o' clearing, scurryfunging, and
    topping and lopping, afore it'll look anythink like. But it's
    got the making of a puffeck parrydise in it, a puffeck
    parrydise it has&mdash;<i>with</i> my adwice.</p>

    <p><i>S.C.</i> Glad to hear you say so, SMUGGINS. Now what I
    propose is&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>G.O.G.</i> (<i>laying a horny hand on</i> S.C.'s
    <i>coat-sleeve</i>). If you'll ascuse me, Sir, I'll jest give
    yer <i>my</i> ideas. It'll save time. (<i>Lays down artfully
    the lines of a plan involving radical alteration of paths, and
    lawns, and beds, shifting of shrubs, cutting down of trees,
    rooting up of trailers, and what he calls "toppin' an' loppin'"
    to a tremendous extent.</i>) <i>Then</i>, Sir, you'll 'ave a
    bit o' garding as'll be the pride o' yer eye, and a tidy bit o'
    profit into the bargain, or I don't know my bizness. An' I
    <i>oughter</i> too, seeing as I wos 'ed gardener to the Dook of
    FITZ-FUZZ for close on twenty year, afore the rheumaticks took
    me like wot you see. Hu-a-a-h!!!</p>

    <p><i>S.C.</i> Yes; but, SMUGGINS, all these alterations will
    run into time and&mdash;expense, I'm afraid.</p>

    <p><i>G.O.G.</i> (<i>confidentially).</i> You leave that to
    <i>me</i>, Sir! The fust expense'll be the biggest, and a
    saving in the long run, take <i>my</i> word. And then you
    <i>will</i> 'ave a garding, <i>you</i> will, one as that 'ere
    muddled up bit o' greenery nex door won't be a patch on it, for
    all he's so proud of it.(<i>Gets</i> Simple Citizen <i>into his
    clutches, and works him to his will</i>.)</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>The Same, six months later in the
        Season.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>S.C.</i> (<i>returning from a fortnight's absence</i>).
    What, SMUGGINS, still at it? And&mdash;eh&mdash;by Jove, what
    <i>have</i> you been up to? Why I hardly know the place
    again!</p>

    <p><i>G.O.G.</i> (<i>complacently</i>). I should 'ope not, Sir
    It <i>is</i> a bit different from when you last saw it, I
    flatter myself. Fact it is a garding, now. <i>Then</i> it wos a
    wildernidge!</p>

    <p><i>S.C.</i> Yes, but SMUGGINS, hang it all, you've cut
    almost every bit of greenery away!</p>

    <p><i>G.O.G.</i> (<i>contemptuously</i>). Greenery!!! And who
    wants <i>greenery</i>? Greenery ain't gardening, greenery ain't
    not by chorks. Any fool, even that cove nex door, can grow
    <i>greenery</i>!</p>

    <p><i>S.C.</i> Yes, but SMUGGINS, I <i>don't</i> like my limes
    to look like gouty posts, my branchy elms to show as bare as
    broom-sticks, and my fruit-trees to be trimmed into
    timber-screens!</p>

    <p><i>G.O.G.</i> (<i>persuasively</i>). No, Sir, cert'ny
    <i>not</i>. Fact is they'd bin let grow wild so long that
    cutting on 'em freely back wos the only way to save 'em. Jest
    wait till next year, Sir, and <i>you</i>'ll see.</p>

    <p><i>S.C.</i> (<i>doubtfully</i>). Humph! Looks beastly now,
    anyhow. And you've altered all the paths, and nearly all the
    beds. I didn't tell you&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>G.O.G.</i> (<i>emphatically</i>). No, Sir, you didn't.
    You give me <i>cart blarnch</i>, you did, and I've done my
    level best. The Dook 'ad the same idees at first, but when he
    comes to know me, he says, says he, SMUGGINS, you're always
    right, he says. If you wos to run a reaping-machine through my
    horchids, or a traction-engine over my turf, I should know as
    you wos a-doing of the right thing&mdash;<i>in</i> the long
    run! Oh, you leave it to me, Sir, and you won't repent it.
    And&mdash;ahem&mdash;here's my little haccount,

    order that I might "grow my hown wegerbles," as he phrased it.
    He got money from me for the best and most expensive "ashleaf
    kidneys" and "Prooshian Blues," then planted cheap refuse from
    a small greengrocer's. My "ashleaf kidneys" turned out waxy
    marbles; my Prooshian Blues refused to pod; I spent&mdash;or
    rather he received&mdash;pounds upon my vinery and cucumber
    frames. My grape-bunches went mouldy, and I never got a
    cucumber more than six inches long. His "friend, the florist,"
    did, no doubt. He stole my shrubs overnight, and sold 'em back
    to me next morning. He bled my maidservants for "beer and
    'baccy." In fact, it was the same all round; he had, in every
    way, ruined my garden, run me up exorbitant bills, and then,
    when the day of detection was imminent&mdash;disappeared. If
    ever I catch sight of that mulberry nose of his, I shall be
    tempted to&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>S.F.</i> (<i>soothingly</i>). Ah, yes, just so. But let's
    hope that you'll never come across this particular Grand Old
    Gardener&mdash;or his like&mdash;again. (<i>Waggishly.</i>) By
    Jove, APPLEYARD, no wonder the world went wrong, seeing that
    "the first man" was&mdash;a Gardener!!!</p>

    <p>LEARNED BY ART.&mdash;"Beasts in Bond Street!" "Sheep in the
    Salon!" Messrs. DOWDESWELLS have taken the wind out of the
    sails of the Agricultural Hall, and Mr. DENOVAN ADAM has given
    us the opportunity of seeing a superb collection of Scottish
    Highland Cattle. Mountain, meadow, moss and moor have all been
    laid under contribution. The result is we can have the chance
    of studying these hornymental animals without being tossed, and
    staring at them without being gored. In the same gallery may be
    seen a series of pastels of Hampstead Heath, by Mr. HENRY
    MUHRMAN&mdash;a merman ought to be a sea-painter by rights, but
    no matter! The poet has told us that, "'Amsted am the place to
    ruralise on a summer's day!" The artist convinces us it is the
    place to "pastelise," and he seems to have pastelised to the
    tune of forty pictures very successfully.</p>

    <h2>PARS ABOUT PICTURES.</h2>

    <h4><i>Par ci&mdash;par la!</i></h4>

    <p>"A good par here, and a bad par there; here a par, and there
    a par, and everywhere a par!" Indeed, as an Irishman would say,
    it is the Judgment of Pars. Let us look in at the Institute,
    and see the Painters in Ile, and no doubt we shall be iley
    delighted. We go on the pre-private view day. Not that we are
    parsimonious, but we prefer to see the pictures without being
    scrouged.</p>

             Fawkes blown up.
    </div>

    <p>"<i>The Release</i>" is a puzzler. We have taken stock of
    Mr. STOCK's picture, and fail to understand it. Is it LULU or
    ZAZEL? There seems to have been an explosion, and one person,
    lightly attired, is blown up; and another, more warmly clad, is
    blown down. They will both probably catch cold. Nothing hazy
    about Mr. HAYES's pictures. On the contrary, fresh and
    brilliant&mdash;notably, "<i>A Grey Sunset.</i>" If you are
    subject to <i>mal-de-mer</i>, his seas will make you onaisy.
    The President, Sir JAMES LINTON, has only two small pictures,
    both cleverly painted, but each may be described as a little
    LINTON; so let us give him a little hint on the subject; like
    OLIVER TWIST, we ask for more. "<i>Too Many Cooks</i>," by
    BURTON BARBER&mdash;a Barber who knows how to dress hair. See
    the dogs' coats. Miss ETHEL WRIGHT is not very far wrong in her
    picture of a fair <i>canoiste</i>, and Mr. W.L. WYLLIE is both
    artful and wily in his rendering of a "<i>A Sou' Wester</i>."
    "<i>An Old Harbour in Sussex</i>" gives distinct evidence that
    LEWIS (C.J.) has been moved to the coast, and it seems to be a
    move in the right direction. In "<i>The Red Canoe</i>," Mr.
    ALFRED PARSONS delivers an eloquent sermon on the joys of life
    on the Thames.</p>

    <p>The Royal Society of British Artists have fewer pictures
    than usual at their new show. Quality better than common. Mr.
    F. BRANGWYN's "<i>Funeral at Sea</i>" is excellent. Mr. R.
    MACHELL's "<i>Lakshmi</i>," not easy to understand. It might be
    "Lakshmi, or the Lost Bathing-dress." She might certainly say,
    "I lacks my <i>costume de bain</i>." "<i>Durham</i>"&mdash;good
    landscape by Mr. YGLESIAS. Mr. NELSON DAWSON in his "<i>Sunset
    Breeze</i>," gives us real sea and good seamanship. In
    "<i>Trying it Over</i>," Mr. LOMAX has tried it over to some
    purpose, and has produced a successful little picture of an
    enthusiastic flautist. Mr. G.F. WATTS sends "<i>Lord
    Tennyson</i>." But why in ermine? The Laureate is quite good
    enough for us without his Peer's robes. What did HARRY THE
    EIGHTH say concerning HOLBEIN? Anything more to see? Of course
    there is. But what is my text? "Pars about Pictures." And so I
    pass about. <i>I</i> mustn't linger, but remain</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday Morning</i>.&mdash;Still in Edinburgh, but going
    home to-night. Just received telegram from Member for SARK.
    "Come home at once," he says; "the <i>Peronospora
    Schleideniana</i> has got at the onions."</p>

    <p>Rather a shock to have news like this flashed upon one with
    that absence of deliberation that sometimes marks the telegraph
    service. But I cannot say I am surprised. I had, indeed, before
    leaving, called SARK's attention to what I recognised as the
    greyish mycelial threads of the fungus spreading upon the pipes
    and budding seed-heads. If SARK had steeped the seed in
    sulphate of copper before planting it, this wouldn't have
    happened. It's a pity, for I rather thought we would make
    something towards expenses out of that onion-bed. There's no
    more profitable crop than your pickling onions if well farmed.
    I know a man who made &pound;150 an acre out of his onions. But
    then he wasn't hampered in his arrangements with a fellow like
    SARK.</p>

    <p>Called on Mr. G. to say good-bye. He was sympathetic about
    the onion blight, but I could see that his mind was occupied
    with other and perhaps equally saddening thoughts.</p>

    <p>"I suppose you have been made aware of the intelligence that
    has reached me through the usual sources?" he said. "I have had
    a pretty good time here. I have belaboured the Government from
    all points of attack. I think I managed pretty well with the
    Disestablishment Question. You don't think, TOBY," he said,
    with a passing look of deeper apprehension, "that I gave myself
    away at all on the matter? The worst of these fellows is that
    they keep a record of every word I say, a custom which
    seriously hampers one in his movements. What I should like, if
    it were permitted, would be to come quite fresh to a question
    year after year, and say upon it exactly what happened to be
    convenient, without having before my eyes the certainty that
    somebody would dig out what I said on the same subject last
    year, or five years ago."</p>

    <p>I assured him that I thought not much could be made out of
    his remarks on Disestablishment Question. In fact it would be
    difficult to prove that he had said anything at all. Brightened
    up at this; but cloud again deepened over his mobile face.</p>

    <p>"Yes, perhaps I've done pretty well," he said, with a sigh.
    "I have steered through a very difficult position without
    running ashore; I have had an immense popular reception; I have
    stirred up the constituency, and have, if I may say so,
    supplied with fresh oil the sacred lamp of Liberalism. Now,
    just when I was beginning in some modest measure to felicitate
    myself, there comes news of a crushing master-stroke devised by
    the Government. Though I do not disguise my discomfiture, I
    would not withhold my tribute of admiration at the brilliancy
    of the stroke, of the genius of its conception, and of the
    completeness with which it has been dealt. I have been here
    more than a week, and have delivered four speeches. The
    Government and their friends on the platform and in the press
    affect to sneer at my efforts and their influence. Still, they
    feel it is necessary to make a counter-demonstration, and to
    effectually undo whatever work I may have accomplished. What
    course do they adopt? Why, they send down ASHMEAD-BARTLETT. He
    was at Dalkeith last night, and, in a single speech, destroyed
    the effect of my great effort of Saturday. He will go to West
    Calder; he will come here; he will follow me step by step with
    relentless energy, tearing up, so to speak, the rails I have
    laid, and which I had hoped would have safely conducted the
    Liberal train into the Westminster station. <i>Sic vos non
    vobis</i>. It is cruel, it is crushing. If I had only foreseen
    it, I would have remained at Hawarden, and you might have
    averted the calamity that overshadows your Garden."</p>

    <p>Quite distressed to see my venerated friend broken down. Bad
    for him to stop at home and brood over calamity. Best thing
    would be change of scene and thought. He had made engagement
    to-day to go to Pumpherston and inspect oil and candle works.
    Better keep it.</p>

    <p>"No," said Mr. G., wearily, "oil comforts me not, nor
    candles either. Now, if it were pork, it would be different.
    Few things so interesting as pork. Not from a dietetic point of
    view, but regarded historically. As I mentioned to a
    Correspondent the other day, in the course of Homeric work I
    have examined into the use of pork by the ancients. A very
    curious subject. I shall make some references to it in the
    closing paper which I am writing for <i>Good Words</i> on the
    Old Testament. I am under the impression that the dangers which
    lurk beneath the integument of a leg (or sirloin) of pork, are
    specially connected with the heat of Southern climates."</p>

    <p>Curious to see how rapidly his aspect changed as these
    thoughts pressed upon his mind. When I came in, he had been
    sitting in an arm-chair, with his head resting on his hand, and
    his brow painfully wrinkled. He looked quite old&mdash;at least
    seventy. Now he was up, walking about the room with springy
    stride, his mind actively engaged in framing theories on the
    use of pork by HOMER's contemporaries. If I could only keep him
    engaged, he would forget the blow that had descended upon him,
    and would regain his usual equanimity. A question as to whether
    he thought Achilles liked sage with his pork, cunningly led him
    on to a long disquisition, till, in a quarter of an hour, he
    was quite a changed man, and set out with great energy for
    Pumpherston.</p>

    <p>Fine enthusiasm along the route. Immense reception from the
    working men. Splendid luncheon set out at one end of the shed
    where we were assembled; bill of fare included crude oil,
    sulphate of ammonia, various mineral oils, and candles made
    from paraffin. There was no wine, but plenty of ammonia-water.
    Manager presented Mrs. G. with bust in paraffin wax, which he
    said was Mr. G. Also handed her a packet of dips cunningly
    carved in the likeness of HERBERT, the wick combed out so as to
    represent a shock of hair. Mr. G. delighted; standing on a
    barrel of paraffin, he addressed the company in a luminous
    speech, tracing back the candle to the earliest times. That
    candles existed in the Mosaic era, he reminded them, was shown
    by the question which had puzzled succeeding ages&mdash;as to
    the precise locality in which the great Law-giver stood when
    the medium of illumination provided for his convenience was
    suddenly extinguished. This was a great hit; enthusiasm knew no
    bounds. Hospitality of the Pumpherston people really
    embarrassing; they filled our pockets with candles of all sizes
    and descriptions, and insisted upon each of us taking away a
    quart bottle of paraffin oil imperfectly corked.</p>

    <p>Never shall I forget the radiant look of Mr. G. as he left
    the works loaded with candles and congratulations, whilst Mrs.
    G., walking by his side, carefully carried the bust in paraffin
    wax. He had evidently forgotten all about ASHMEAD-BARTLETT.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>DEATH-BALL; OR, A NEW NAME FOR IT.</h2>

    <p>Yesterday the celebrated Midland Spine-splitters met the
    Ribcracking Rovers at the prepared Ambulance Grounds recently
    opened in conjunction with the local County Hospital. A large
    staff of medical men, supplied with all the necessary surgical
    appliances, were in attendance. Play commenced effectively, the
    Rovers keeping the ball well before them, with only a few
    broken arms, a dislocated thigh, and a fractured jaw or two.
    Later, however, affairs moved more briskly, one of the
    Spine-splitter forwards getting the ball well down to goal;
    but, being met with "opposition," he was carried senseless from
    the field. A lively scrimmage followed, amid a general cracking
    of ribs and snapping of spines. The field now being covered
    with wounded, the Police interfered, and the play terminated in
    a draw.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
